this is ryan riley's (ansible solutions architect) git repo for my config-as-code. feel free to use this as a starting point for your migration or automated backups.

note: use export_24.yml with any envrionment lower than 2.4, and use export.yml for anything 2.5 or newer

disclaimer: this is not meant to be a supported migration path or backup strategy and is meant to be a starting place. the classic saying of "well, it works on my laptop" definitely applies here.
